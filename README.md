# Test-Cases
- VSTO (Visual Studio Tools for Office) Add-ins are a specific type of COM add-ins. They are also created using .NET languages but with a more focused integration within the Visual Studio environment, aiming to simplify the development process.
- Majorly manual testing has been implemented for this project.
- Test Scenarios can be found in [Trello]([url](https://trello.com/b/6TEpZ4op/test-scenarios)).
- I have attached the file for test cases, test execution, test summary, and bug reports.
